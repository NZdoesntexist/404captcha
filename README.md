# 404 CAPTCHA Demo

This repository contains a playful demo of a Windows 95 themed CAPTCHA page.
After a mock boot screen and a set of joke "verification" pop‑ups, the user is
asked to complete a drag‑and‑drop puzzle to rebuild a small robot within a time
limit. Solving it displays a success message with links, while failure shows an
error overlay.

## Running locally
No build step is required. Simply open `index.html` in a modern web browser and
follow the on‑screen instructions.

## Puzzle showcase
The page demonstrates a stack of pop‑up dialogs followed by a timed puzzle that
uses pointer events for drag and drop, accompanied by retro‑style sounds and
fonts.

## Browser requirements
A recent desktop browser with JavaScript enabled and pointer event support
(Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.) is recommended. Audio playback may require a user
interaction on some mobile or older browsers, and the layout is optimized for
larger screens.
